# DL-for-ComputerVision
This repo contain my trials to implement and do the assignments of the  Deep Learning for Computer Vision course, by Justin Johnson at Michigan University 2019. In this course, Justin with his team  cover learning algorithms, neural network architectures, and practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning networks for visual recognition tasks. Personally, is one of the most useful and rich courses in deep learning and vision. Moreover, I add some materials and works I did during my coursework phase at [African Masters Of Machine Intelligence (AMMI)](https://aimsammi.org/)
